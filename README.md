# Decentralized Health Record System

Intelligent Health Record System

The aim of the system is to provide the users ease of handling their health records and also providing them the authority to ensure controlled access of these records. The user has control over all aspects of the records and can henceforth provide access to parts of data to authorised health providers for a given period of time. The user can also revoke access to data as and when required. The verified health providers have the authority to update and upload various health records like lab test results or any new observations .For instance, a general physician is given access to the general health records only whereas a specialist may have access to other specific records like blood tests and lipid profile depending upon the requirement .The system enables users to visit a general physician , a specialist or lab technician without being worried of carrying all necessary records and also maintain uniform records with the option to easily update the reports when needed. The user could potentially offer parts of their profile to be queried by interested third-parties, such as researchers or pharmaceuticals. At a global scale, data becomes more reliable and available.
